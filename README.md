# 4chan-crawlerJS

## Preamble

[tomcat-bit/4chan-crawler](https://github.com/tomcat-bit/4chan-crawler) provides and easy to use crawler for the live site, which I wanted to rework for crawling the archive and collecting text as well as media. [Archive.4plebs.org](https://archive.4plebs.org) DDos protection blocks requests from `python-requests`, but not from Node's `https`, so I built a JS version.

## Installation

`npm i 4chan-crawler`

### Setup
`npm i`
## Usage
Update Desired boards and output directory in `config.js`

`npm start`
